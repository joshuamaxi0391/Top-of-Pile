# Top of Pile

A pair of implementations (C and MIPS assembly) of an image‐processing routine that determines which colored part sits on top of a pile. Given a 64×64 “pile” of pixels (with 0 = background and 1–7 = different part colors), the programs scan the image and identify the topmost non-zero color.
