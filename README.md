This project goes over two different implementations of the same problem.
Both codes scan over an image given to it and finds the specific color part that is on top of the pile.
This is done by checking the overlap between the pieces and whichever one has no overlap is the one on top.
The C implementation is fully based on accuracy while the MIPS assembly implementation is more focused on efficiency.
